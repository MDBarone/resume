%%% DATA SCIENCE BLURB
Polymath with over 10 years of academic and professional experience in psychology and data science. I have created innovative human-centric analysis for market analysis, user segmentation, feature selection, machine learning, and key performance metric generation specialized to client needs. I provide interpretable evaluations of complex behaviour with a degree of innovation that only comes from being a trailblazer in the field.

% I excel at understanding complex interdisciplinary ideas quickly and communicate import milestones to people with diverse expertise at multiple layers of abstraction.
% I am familiar with ETL software such as Talend and have contributed to GitHub repositories using Docker images. 
%%% MUSIC DATA ARCHITECTURE BLURB
% I am a polymath with academic and professional experience in psychology and data science. My expertise as a data engineer specifically within the music industry specifically second-to-none. Most importantly, I am a leader in the field of music information retrieval, having architected massive digital libraries of linked music metadata information from dozens of APIs and published on how future protocols should be implemented to maintain and improve the entire corpus of digital music.

%  I have achieved 90\% accuracy with machine learning, deep learning, and Bayesian Modelling on an eclectic assortment of datasets including music metadata, digital user behaviors, and audio signals, financial data, electroencephalography recordings, motion capture, and eye-tracking.

% When it comes to people and data, I know how to address all of your data needs: from recommending innovative analysis to best practices for data collection and storage. Most importantly, I am a pioneer in my field - capable of addressing complex behavioural questions with a quantitative rigor unlike most in my field.

% I provide interpretable evaluations of complex behaviour and offer feedback on how to best model and improve KPIs.
